## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alizaali94/Cookbook.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Cookbook
```

3. Start the Metro Server. First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native. To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of project:

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

4. Start / Run the application. Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native run-android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npx react-native run-ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see Cookbook running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
